The Flatiron Library Network is a mockup website for a hypothetical group of libraries. Users may browse from a list of books, check out books, and review their account status.

### HOW TO USE ### 
Log in via "Log in", or create a new account via "Sign Up". After logging in, go to the "Books" menu and browse for a book. After clicking on a book title, the option to check out a book will appear. A user's list of checked-out books may be viewed on their profile page, found by clicking the link in the upper right.

After performing a book search, users will be given the option to request a new book via clicking on "Didn't find your book? Request a book". Click this link, then enter the desired title. The site will then search the Google Books API, and present a list of matching titles. Click "Request Book", select the desired library, and click "Make Request". The book will then be added to the specified library. 


### DATABASE INFORMATION ### 
Books are seeded from the Google Books API. An initial set of sample books has been seeded by the application. Further books may be added by users via the "Request a Book" feature.
